We use a review process to catch errors earlier, maintain standards, familiarize the team with what has been written, and to catalyze learning.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a feature/fix branch that stems from <strong>master</strong>. If it is a fix branch name it with the following convention: {issue number}_{lowercased issue title with spaces as underscores}</li>
<li>Make your changes, but remember that commit messages should be descriptive but brief.</li>
<li>When the feature/fix is complete and tests pass then stage, commit, and push the changes to the repository.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request, this will post a notification into the proper company chat channel.</li>
<li>Someone other than the author and with decent familiarity of the project will review the request and <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review">make comments, ask questions, and quality check</a>.</li>
<li>When satisfied, they comment on the pull request &ldquo;Ready to merge.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Merge the branch into <strong>master</strong>. At this point continuous integration will deploy the code as long as it builds successfully and passes all tests.</li>
<li>Delete your local and remote feature/fix branch.</li>
</ol>
</article><article id='platforms'><header><h1>Platforms</h1></header></article><article id='version_control'><header><h1>Version Control</h1></header><p>We use version control for all of our projects. Version control software, for those unfamiliar, is a lot like a really fancy <strong>undo</strong> button but for code&hellip;and a bunch of other types of files. The difference is that unlike an undo button that only undoes a linear set of changes, version control systems allow for <strong>braches</strong> to be cloned from a source <strong>repo</strong> and then changed without changing the master copy of the code until you&rsquo;re ready. This is perfect for experimenting with new ideas, undoing mistakes, and showing accountability.</p>

<p>For our version control we use Git. It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s open sourced, and it&rsquo;s awesome. You <em>git</em> me, dog?</p>

<p>And last but not least, we use Github to share our repositories with the <strong>WORLD</strong>!</p>
